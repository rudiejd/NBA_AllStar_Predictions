# NBA All Star Predictions

## Overview
A quick Jupyter notebook I threw together to make some predictions about the 2021 NBA All Star game. 

Scrapes NBA individual typical + advanced statistics and all star lists from publicly available sources and uses these as an input for: 
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Trees
 - Random Forest
 - Support Vector Machine
 - Multi-Layer Perception Classifier
 
 Performs some basic analysis to help determine which statistics are correlated. I also tried some basic over/under sampling techniques to no avail.
 
 ## Results
 I included the results from each model in the predictions folder. You can find accuracy statistics by running the notebook yourself. I may post some here later for at least the
 most accurate models I have found.
